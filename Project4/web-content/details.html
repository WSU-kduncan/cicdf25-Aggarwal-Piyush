      <h2>What Happened</h2>
      <p>
        According to AWS’s post-incident summary, a network configuration
        change in us-east-1 propagated incorrectly to backbone routers.
        The update caused packet loss between core services and led to
        cascading failures across several regions.
      </p>

      <h2>Impact</h2>
      <p>
        Many major platforms—streaming services, retail sites, and
        educational tools—experienced downtime. Internal dashboards,
        billing APIs, and the AWS Management Console were intermittently
        unavailable.
      </p>

      <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Implement multi-region failover for critical workloads.</li>
        <li>Maintain independent DNS and status monitoring tools.</li>
        <li>Review change-management and rollback procedures.</li>
        <li>Communicate transparently during incidents.</li>
      </ul>
